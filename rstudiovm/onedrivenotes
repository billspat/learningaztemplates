the --single-directory parameter is the name of the directory within onedrive, the syncdir parameter is the location that directory will be synchronized to
on the VM

In order to maintain synchronization between VM files and onedrive files, use the following command:
onedrive --monitor --single-directory '<dir_name>' --syncdir '<dir_name>' --monitor-interval <seconds>
the --single-directory parameter is the name of the directory within onedrive, the syncdir parameter is the location that directory will be synchronized to
on the VM, the --monitor-interval parameter is the duration between automatic synchronizations
NOTE: this will synchronize every time a file is saved, or the --monitor-interval amount of seconds has passed.
NOTE: this will keep the terminal busy for as long as it is running, this can be stopped by running ctrl+C in the command line
